## Main problem statements and solutions

Main problem statements:

1. Displaying a large number of adventures in a feed: The app has a vast collection of adventures, and the challenge is to efficiently display them in a feed format. The feed should load quickly to provide a smooth user experience.
2. Personalizing the feed: The app aims to show adventures that are most relevant to each user. It is necessary to implement a mechanism to personalize the feed based on user preferences or other relevant factors. This ensures that users see adventures that align with their interests.
3. Preventing duplicate adventures: The app should avoid displaying the same adventure multiple times in the feed unless the user explicitly wants to see it again. This requires a way to track and manage adventures that have already been shown to the user.
4. Handling unknowns and ambiguity: The project intentionally leaves certain aspects vague to assess how candidates handle ambiguity. This includes determining the specific requirements, making assumptions, and effectively communicating questions and assumptions during the follow-up call.
5. Time constraints: The test has a limited time frame of 1.5 to 2 hours for the coding part. Candidates are not expected to complete the entire task but rather provide a starting point that demonstrates their approach, problem-solving skills, and ability to work within time constraints.
